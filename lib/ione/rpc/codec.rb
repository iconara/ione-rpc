    # Codecs are used to encode and decode the messages sent between the client
    # and server. Codecs must be able to decode frames in a streaming fashion,
    # i.e. frames that come in pieces.
    #
    # Codecs can be configured to compress frame bodies by giving them a
    # compressor. A compressor is an object that responds to `#compress`,
    # `#decompress` and `#compress?`. The first takes a string and returns
    # a compressed string, the second does the reverse and the third is a way
    # for the compressor to advice the codec whether or not it's meaningful to
    # encode the frame at all. `#compress?` will get the same argument as
    # `#compress` and should return true or false. It could for example return
    # true when the frame size is over a threshold value.
    #
    # If you want to control how messages are framed you can implement your
    # own codec from scratch by implementing {#encode} and {#decode}, but most
    # of the time you should only need to implement {#encode_message} and
    # {#decode_message} which take care of encoding and decoding the message,
    # and leave the framing to the default implementation. If you decide to
    # implement {#encode} and {#decode} you don't need to subclass this class.
    #
    # Codecs must be stateless.
    #
    # Since the IO layer has no knowledge about the framing it can't know
    # how many bytes are needed before a frame can be fully decoded so instead
    # the codec needs to be able to process partial frames. At the same time
    # a codec can be used concurrently and must be stateless. To support partial
    # decoding a codec can return a state instead of a decoded message until
    # a complete frame can be decoded.
    #
    # The codec must return three values: the last value must be true if a
    # if a message was decoded fully, and false if not enough bytes were
    # available. When it is true the first piece is the message and the second
    # the channel. When it is false the first piece is the partial decoded
    # state (this can be any object at all) and the second is nil. The partial
    # decoded state will be passed in as the second argument on the next call.
    #
    # In other words: the first time {#decode} is called the second argument
    # will be nil, but on subsequent calls, until the third return value is
    # true, the second argument will be whatever was returned by the previous
    # call.
    #
    # The buffer might contain more bytes than needed to decode a frame, and
    # the implementation must not consume these. The implementation must
    # consume all of the bytes of the current frame, but none of the bytes of
    # the next frame.
    #
    # Codecs must also make sure that these (conceptual) invariants hold:
    # `decode(encode(message, channel)) == [message, channel]` and
    # `encode(decode(frame)) == frame` (the return values are not entirely
    # compatible, but the concept should be clear).

      # Decodes a frame, piece by piece if necessary.
      #
      # Since the codec can be called before a full frame has been received it
      # returns a three-tuple where the last component is a boolean flag that says
      # whether or not the frame is completely decoded. As long as the buffer
      # does not contain a full frame the first component will be a state object
      # which must be passed in as the second argument on the next call to
      # {#decode}. When the buffer contains a full frame {#decode_message} will
      # be called and the decoded message returned as the first component, the
      # second will be the channel and the third will be true.
      #
      # When the compression flag is set the codec uses the configured compressor
      # to decode the frame before passing the decompressed bytes to
      # {#decode_message}.
      #
      # Since the IO thread can spend a significant proportion of its time doing
      # frame decoding (the encoding is done in the calling thread) there is an
      # option to create "lazy" codecs that return an intermediate object instead
      # of a decoded message. When the codec is created with the `:lazy` option
      # {#decode} returns an object with a `#decode` method, that in turn returns
      # the decoded message.
