    # This is the base class of client peers.
    #
    # You can either create a subclass and add your own high-level convenience
    # methods for constructing and sending your custom requests, or you can
    # create a standalone client object and call {#send_request}.
    #
    # A subclass may optionally implement {#initialize_connection} to send a
    # message immediately on a successful connection, and {#choose_connection}
    # to decide which connection to use for a request.
    #
    # The client will handle connections to multiple server peers, and
    # automatically reconnect to them when they disconnect.
    class Client

      #   strings on the format host:port (e.g. `['host1:1111', 'host2:2222']`).
      # @option options [Ione::Io::IoReactor] :io_reactor use this option to
      #   make the client use an existing IO reactor and not create its own.
      #   Please note that {#stop} will still stop the reactor.
      # @option options [Integer] :connection_timeout (5) the number of seconds
      #   to wait for connections to be established before failing.
      # @option options [Integer] :max_channels (128) the maximum number of
      #   channels supported for each connection.
      # @option options [Logger] :logger a logger conforming to the standard
      #   Ruby logger API that will be used to log significant events like
      #   request failures.
